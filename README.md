# Supply & Demand Market Simulation

This is a very basic market simulation based on [the video by
Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8).

Note that while methods have been added to permit a player to buy/sell goods, in
the current implementation the only effect on the simulation is that trade
volume drops significantly after a player trade, before recovering fully within
a round or two; market price is, unfortunately, largely unaffected. While this
can be fixed, I'm moving on to other methods.
